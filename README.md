 Game made with local llm and openai whisper in unity
i had to re make the repo because there was a large file problem when pushing
** required for project to work **
1- in Assets/StreamingAssets/Whisper/
   download ggml-base.en.bin from https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main and place it there

2- in unity scene Game download the Local LLM model qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf to make sure everything works
